          <h2 class="description">Art I like</h2>
          <p class= "description">"The first art's expression I started to give some kind of interest was definitelly music. From my balladeur Cd to handling my spotify account not so well, music always had so much importance in my life. More than music, what I love about art, is that it can be seen everywhere. I draw and paint a lot, but everything for me can be art. Clothes are art, sports are art, and being able to take things from each of them and mixing them together is more than passional."</p>

        <p class= "description">"From Rosa Parks to Billy Jean King, I've always been interested in powerful, mindful women. I've been raised by a mother who taught me that women are as strong as men, definitely smarter, and that at every stage in life, we will have to fight more for the same."</p>

        <p class= "description">"I've learned about the world at a young age. My grandmother spent the last years of her life travelling in every fucking places of the world and taught me everything about them even before I've been taught how to read. Once this skill was reached, I dive into the world of Jules Verne. The first one I read was 20000 lieux sous les mers, and then, Le Tour du Monde en 80 jours. For sure, this book gave me the envy to discover every places Phileas went."</p>
